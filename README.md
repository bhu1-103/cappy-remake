# Recommendation for Publication& Detailed Suggestions

- [ ] [1. *The problem and objectives are not well presented, and they need to be made more explicit.*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point1)

- [ ] [*2. The technical presentation needs to be improved:*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point2)

- [ ] [*3. How can we justify that only the three parameters considered (Table 4) are sufficient for performance evaluation in a WLAN OBSS?*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point3)

- [ ] [*4. What parallels can be drawn between a simulated system and a real system in the results?*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point4)

- [ ] [*5. There is no comparison with other work in the field. This is particularly necessary for the performance of machine learning models.*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point5)

## point1

- sir will do this

## point2

- this will be done in the end

## point3

- sir will do this
- can show covariance between all output variables and hence prove that the 3 parameters are sufficient

## point4

- is this whether komondor is an accurate simulator or not?

## point5

- for this, we can find other projects which use the same model but in a different scenario. justification: `in the end, its just numbers and data, if we get similar data with node and edge properties or pull out something in similar with another project's model, then we can use it for comparison and also prove accordingly that it should work with this data`
