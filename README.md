- [ ] [1. *The problem and objectives are not well presented, and they need to be made more explicit.*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/#point1)

- [ ] [*2. The technical presentation needs to be improved:*]()

- [ ] [*3. How can we justify that only the three parameters considered (Table 4) are sufficient for performance evaluation in a WLAN OBSS?*]()

- [ ] [*4. What parallels can be drawn between a simulated system and a real system in the results?*]()

- [ ] [*5. There is no comparison with other work in the field. This is particularly necessary for the performance of machine learning models.*]()
