[ ] - `The problem and objectives are not well presented, and they need to be made more explicit.`

[ ] `The technical presentation needs to be improved:`]

[ ] `How can we justify that only the three parameters considered (Table 4) are sufficient for performance evaluation in a WLAN OBSS?`]

[ ] `What parallels can be drawn between a simulated system and a real system in the results?`]

[ ] `There is no comparison with other work in the field. This is particularly necessary for the performance of machine learning models.`]
