# Recommendation for Publication& Detailed Suggestions

- [ ] [1. *The problem and objectives are not well presented, and they need to be made more explicit.*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point1)

- [ ] [*2. The technical presentation needs to be improved:*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point2)

- [ ] [*3. How can we justify that only the three parameters considered (Table 4) are sufficient for performance evaluation in a WLAN OBSS?*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point3)

- [ ] [*4. What parallels can be drawn between a simulated system and a real system in the results?*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point4)

- [ ] [*5. There is no comparison with other work in the field. This is particularly necessary for the performance of machine learning models.*](https://github.com/bhu1-103/cappy-remake/?tab=readme-ov-file#point5)
